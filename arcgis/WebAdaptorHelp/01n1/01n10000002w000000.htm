It also reduces dependencies between the machine running  <span purpose="ph" varid="ArcGISforServer" translate="no">ArcGIS Server</span> and the remote storage device. If you plan to host cached map and image services, using local directories, direct attached, or storage area network volumes (dedicated to the server) are recommended, as this typically yields the highest performance.  Cache tile retrieval over a shared network location  is a particularly expensive operation.</p></div><div class="section1" id="ESRI_SECTION1_84CAF0B6A8CB4B099A7154B6552197C6" purpose="section1"><h2>ArcGIS Web Adaptor or reverse proxy server</h2><p id="GUID-388B0671-07A8-4E8A-9FA6-2B2C417FC833">No ArcGIS Web Adaptor or reverse proxy server is used in this configuration. Your GIS web services and administrative requests are applied directly against <span purpose="ph" varid="ArcGISforServer" translate="no">ArcGIS Server</span>'s default port (6080). Clients access the site by connecting directly to <span purpose="ph" varid="ArcGISforServer" translate="no">ArcGIS Server</span> through HTTP on port 6080. For example, the URL to the site would be <span class="usertext">http://gisserver.domain.com:6080</span>.    Clients can optionally use HTTPS on port 6443 to access the site securely.</p><p id="GUID-1B054F32-8094-4D51-A56D-2EB8AA6B0910">The advantage of not using ArcGIS Web Adaptor or a reverse proxy server is that the installation and configuration of your site does not require any knowledge of third-party web technologies. The absence of  extra components between your clients and your services eliminates additional overhead that may potentially occur at the web tier.</p><p id="GUID-94D1986F-2866-4A33-81BF-47B6DD60D4A1">While deploying <span purpose="ph" varid="ArcGISforServer" translate="no">ArcGIS Server</span> without ArcGIS Web Adaptor or a reverse proxy server is a valid option, be aware of the following:</p><div class="section2" id="ESRI_SECTION2_86C4F4645D3648EDAFCC23526FD7716C" purpose="section2"><h3>GIS services not available over standard ports</h3><p id="GUID-09D21DAA-8826-494F-A5A0-34D8CE9BD664">Typically, web applications expect HTTP resources to be accessed over port 80, as opposed to 6080 or 6443. Access over port 80 requires use of ArcGIS Web Adaptor or a third-party reverse proxy server.  <span purpose="ph" varid="ArcGISforServer" translate="no">ArcGIS Server</span> does not run on standard ports because it would conflict with third-party web servers that you may already have running in your organization.

In some organizations, especially  intranet environments,  having your applications access services directly over 6080 or 6443 could be  a viable solution.</p></div><div class="section2" id="ESRI_SECTION2_A507CADBDF664C4A8BC65F10202E4927" purpose="section2"><h3><span purpose="ph" varid="ArcGISforServer" translate="no">ArcGIS Server</span> administrative endpoints exposed</h3><p id="GUID-243D7C69-A1F1-4E1A-9805-FF8AA49B0DF0">ArcGIS Server Manager and the <a class="xref" target="_blank" rel="http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/about-the-arcgis-server-administrator-directory.htm" href="http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/about-the-arcgis-server-administrator-directory.htm">ArcGIS Server Administrator Directory</a> are exposed through the same ports (6080 or 6443) that everyone else uses to access services. This does not imply that anyone can administer your server,  because a user needs to provide administrative credentials to perform  administrative operations on the server. However, it is a recommended best practice to block general access to the administrative end points, especially if your server is exposed to the Internet.    If exposing the administrative end points is a concern in your deployment environment, overcome this by specifying that only certain IP addresses can access the server.

While this configuration represents the typical choice for development and testing environments, it is also valid in some production environments (particularly intranet) with moderate security policies. For higher-security environments, a single machine configuration with ArcGIS Web Adaptor or a reverse proxy server is recommended.</p><p id="GUID-984FC322-C2B9-4787-8C0C-04D540555C3E">This configuration is ideal for production environments where cached map and image services must deliver the maximum throughput possible. In organizations with large ArcGIS Server deployments, a single-machine site is a good choice for hosting all cached services.  Other services can be  hosted in a parallel site with one or multiple GIS servers. The performance gains of serving cache tiles from a single-machine deployment may overcome the overhead of having to administer a dedicated GIS server for that purpose.</p><div class="section2" id="ESRI_SECTION2_3688C395477F4175B40FCBF860DC833A" purpose="section2"><h3>Availability</h3><p id="GUID-E0E72C6B-DBA4-4F91-A3C5-E5EE3400884A"> Since there is only one GIS server, there is a single point of failure.

It is not possible to add extra GIS servers to the site to increase computing power. Scalability is vertical only and can be increased by adding additional cores to the GIS server.  This configuration can efficiently take advantage of modern hardware with many cores.</p></div><div class="section2" id="ESRI_SECTION2_1CCD044CCCB34FA982BEF0248EE41942" purpose="section2"><h3>Advantages</h3><ul purpose="ul" id="UL_CA5E2EE4C2974ADAB89F432BA07AC466"><li purpose="li" id="LI_87AF084DAE0940E08DBEAC4D96C37636">Straightforward to install,  maintain, and upgrade.</li><li purpose="li" id="LI_1908C97BE43741E49C522C9E88DDA018">High performance because local paths are used to access resources; this is ideal for hosting cached map and image services.</li></ul></div><div class="section2" id="ESRI_SECTION2_DB178016CDE34B458D94F612310E7D65" purpose="section2"><h3>Disadvantages</h3><ul purpose="ul" id="UL_B6E043DE0B6543EA98F315A66435F59A"><li purpose="li" id="LI_096991266918465CB471896751521BE5">May not fit your security requirements, since ArcGIS Server Manager and ArcGIS Server Administrator Directory are exposed through the same port (6080) that everyone else uses to access the services.
